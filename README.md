## Wall Street Bets Bets
Wall Street Bets Bets is a web scraper made in python that scrapes the Wall street bets subreddit for posts related to a company name or NASDAQ symbol inputed by the user and compares the post details with the details of the company stock price on the day the post was made

## Specs
Made using:
- flask framework
- The Python Reddit Api Wrapper
- Alphavantage API

## Motivation
This was my first Hackathon, I randomly got the idea while waiting in line for lunch and decided to try and implement it. this was the first time I called an api or scraped a website.

## What's next
Nothing right now
